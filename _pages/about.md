Hello and welcome to my website. My name is Sandesh Bhat and I am a Senior Research Fellow at the [Motion Analysis Laboratory](https://www.mayo.edu/research/labs/motion-analysis/overview), and the Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering within the [Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science](https://college.mayo.edu/), Mayo Clinic. My work revolves around orthotic device development for upper extremity rehabilitation. 

I received my Ph.D. in [Systems Engineering](https://poly.engineering.asu.edu/engineering/phd-systems-engineering/) from the [Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering](https://engineering.asu.edu/), Arizona State University. There, I researched in the field of Robotics and Dynamics for Rehabilitation Application. I was advised by [Dr. Sangram Redkar](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/1114748) and [Dr. Thomas Sugar](https://isearch.asu.edu/profile/227786) in the [Robotics and Dynamical Systems Group](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/rads/). I received my Master of Science (MS) degree in [Mechanical Engineering](https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/mechanical-graduate/) from the [Ira A. Fulton School of Engineering](https://engineering.asu.edu/), Arizona State University and my Bachelor of Engineering (BE) Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the [University of Mumbai](http://mu.ac.in/).
