A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.<br>
												- Lao Tzu <br>
<br>
My love for the great outdoors began during my time at Arizona State University, where I was immersed in a community that truly appreciates the beauty and thrill of nature. Hiking, backpacking, camping, and rock climbing became not just hobbies but a way of life for me. The freedom of the open trail, the challenge of scaling a rocky cliff, and the peacefulness of sleeping under the stars are experiences that continue to fuel my passion.<br>

Every year, I make it a point to embark on at least one multi-day backpacking trip, seeking out new trails and challenging myself in different landscapes. And when summer arrives in the Midwest, you’ll find me outdoors, climbing rock faces and connecting with nature in a way that recharges my spirit.<br>

The outdoor lifestyle isn't just about adventure—it's about growth, community, and the joy of discovering something new with every step, ascent, and campfire.
