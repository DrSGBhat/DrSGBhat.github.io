## Abstract

Human walking is an extremely complex neuromuscular activity whose simplicity disappears when an attempt is made to provide a quantitative description of the process. The dynamical systems theory provides a framework for analyzing the stability and chaotic nature of dynamical systems, employing Floquet multipliers (FM) and long and short-term Lyapunov exponents (LE), respectively. This report compares FM and LE from three methods: method A (false nearest neighbors and numerical approximation), method B (false nearest neighbors and semi-analytical technique) and method C (singular value decomposition and semi-analytical technique). Data from 33 healthy older adults with no history of falls were used to explain the dynamic system. A surrogate center of mass trajectory was calculated for the analysis of sway in the transverse plane. Results revealed methodological differences in LE and FM calculations with semi-analytical solutions providing closer approximations to observed gait behavior. The long-term LE from Methods A and B were similar, but other LE pairings differed. Method A’s short-term LE indicated chaotic gaits for all subjects, while long-term LE from Methods A and B indicated chaos for half the subjects. Method C showed non-chaotic gait for most subjects. Method B’s FM indicated over 30% of subjects had unstable gait. Method C yielded values of LE and FM that most closely matched the subjects’ gait patterns. This study offers a methodological foundation for gait analysis using short time-series data, facilitating deeper insights into both stability and chaos within gait dynamics.
