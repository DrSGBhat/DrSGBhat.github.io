## Abstract

There is an increased clinical use of elbow orthoses. It is important to consider patient experiences in their use. Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) serve as essential tools for gathering patient perspectives. This review provides a comprehensive list of PROMs used in clinical trials of elbow orthoses, and documents their properties, uses, and quality. A systematic literature search across PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, and Web of Science identified 31 clinical trials of elbow orthoses that used PROMs as outcome measures. Subsequently, manual searches were conducted to report on each PROM's characteristics. A total of 15 different PROMs were used as outcome measurements in clinical trials that used an elbow orthosis as an intervention for 11 different conditions. Researchers can use this review to aid in making informed decisions about which PROMs to use for future clinical trials.
