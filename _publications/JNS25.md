## Abstract

OBJECTIVE
Idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) is characterized by gait deterioration, cognitive disturbances, and urinary incontinence. Gait deficits pose safety hazards due to frequent falls, yet objective investigations of gait improvement following ventriculoperitoneal shunt (VPS) placement are limited. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess objective improvement in gait parameters for patients with iNPH after VPS placement.

METHODS
All patients treated with a VPS for iNPH by the senior author at a single tertiary care center from December 2017 to January 2023 were retrospectively reviewed. Patients who underwent detailed motion analysis testing before surgery with > 1 follow-up assessment were included. Analyzed parameters included gait velocity, gait cadence, stride length, stride width, gait stability ratio, total support, and single support. Time-dependent linear mixed-effects models and generalized additive mixed-effects models (GAMMs) were used to model short-term and longitudinal gait parameter changes, respectively.

RESULTS
A total of 212 patients (137 male, median age was 75.2 years) who underwent VPS placement for iNPH were included, with a total of 747 gait analyses performed at a median last-gait analysis follow-up duration of 12.0 months. Statistically significant changes in all gait parameter values were seen between the preoperative time point and first postoperative follow-up (within 3 months) time point (paired Wilcoxon p < 0.001), with a statistically significant majority of patients experiencing improvement (binominal p < 0.0001). Longitudinal analyses using a GAMM showed increased gait velocity, single support, and stride length, with decreased stability ratio, step width, and total support at early time points, while a plateau was achieved around 6 months.

CONCLUSIONS
A detailed gait analysis demonstrated significant improvements in objective ambulation metrics, particularly in the gait velocity, stride length, and gait stability ratio, following VPS placement in patients with iNPH. Most patients maintained marked improvement from baseline to the last follow-up assessment, although a plateau of the benefit was experienced over longer follow-up.
