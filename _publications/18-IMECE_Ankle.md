title: "Development of a Passive Prosthetic Ankle With Slope Adapting Capabilities"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/IMECE_Ankle
excerpt: 'In this work, the authors first study different designs of prosthetic ankles. Then, a new design is proposed, and its dynamics are discussed. Various experiments are conducted to verify the concept. The results of the experiments are discussed, and a conclusion is drawn based on the discussion. An OpenSim simulation is run to emulate the effects of the prosthesis on an amputee’s residual leg. Further iterations of the same design are then discussed and presented. Finally, a conclusion is drawn on the usability of the ankle along with some suggestions for future research.'
