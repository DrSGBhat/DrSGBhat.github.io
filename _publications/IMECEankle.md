## Abstract
In this work, the authors first study different designs of prosthetic ankles. Then, a new design is proposed, and its dynamics are discussed. Various experiments are conducted to verify the concept. The results of the experiments are discussed, and a conclusion is drawn based on the discussion. An OpenSim simulation is run to emulate the effects of the prosthesis on an amputee√ïs residual leg. Further iterations of the same design are then discussed and presented. Finally, a conclusion is drawn on the usability of the ankle along with some suggestions for future research.
