## Abstract
Current methods of unmanned underwater locomotion do not meet stealth, robustness and efficiency. This work discuses about designing a Bioinspired UUV or Unmanned Underwater Vehicle that uses an undulating fin approximating to that of a cuttlefish fin locomotion. This propulsion method has higher maneuverability and ability to navigate while leaving its surroundings relatively undisturbed as compared to other propeller based systems. Mathematical models and control algorithms describing the complicated locomotion have been developed, and a simulation model is used to verify the theoretical results. This design of UUV can be utilized for underwater data collection and military applications without hampering the underwater wildlife.
