## Abstract
In this work, state of the art in the field of intent recognition, its application to prostheses and subsequent volitional control algorithms are reviewed. In this paper, competitive landscape is also studied with the aim to learn from the successes and failures of the researchers who have been working in this area. This research hopes to further advance the technology for volitional control of prostheses/wearable robots that will enable much integrated human robot collaboration/interaction specifically focused on passive and active prostheses. The overarching aim of this work is to develop a prosthetic ankle that is as close to a human ankle as possible.
