## Abstract
Nerve transfer or grafting surgery to restore elbow flexion in peripheral nerve injuries has been an effective technique, but alters neuromuscular control compared with healthy individuals. This study compared neuromuscular control in the elbow flexors of 11 unimpaired control subjects and 11 adult patients with traumatic brachial plexus injury who underwent a nerve transfer or grafting procedure to the biceps motor branch to restore elbow flexion. The subjects performed a series of trials to generate a specific percentage of their maximum elbow torque. Each trial had an increasing and decreasing stairstep torque pattern that the subjects were asked to match. The amount of time that the subject's elbow torque was maintained within 5% of the target torque was calculated. The hypothesis was that there was a significant difference in the neuromuscular control between the two groups during elbow isometric torque generation. A secondary hypothesis was that a relationship existed between the neuromuscular control and the torque level for each group. The results demonstrated that neuromuscular control was different between the groups and there were significant differences in how torque levels are generated. The control group more easily modulated their myoelectric activation and achieved greater neuromuscular control variability with varying torque demand. The nerve transfer or grafting group could not modulate their myoelectric activation with changing torque demands. Further studies focusing on the improvement of neuromuscular control are needed to optimize functional outcomes in nerve injury patients.
