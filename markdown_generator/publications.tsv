2017-12-20	Design and Development of a Passive Prosthetic Ankle	"Theses, Arizona State University"	"In this work, different passive prosthetic ankles are studied. It is observed that complicated designs increase the cost of production, but simple designs have limited functionality. A new design for a passive prosthetic ankle is presented that is simple to manufacture while having superior functionality. This prosthetic ankle design has two springs: one mimicking Achilles tendon and the other mimicking Anterior-Tibialis tendon. The dynamics of the prosthetic ankle is discussed and simulated using Working model 2D. The simulation results are used to optimize the springs stiffness. Two experiments are conducted using the developed ankle to verify the simulation It is found that this novel ankle design is better than Solid Ankle Cushioned Heel (SACH) foot. The experimental data is used to find the tendon and muscle activation forces of the subject wearing the prosthesis using OpenSim. A conclusion is included along with suggested future work."

2018-01-01	Development of a Passive Prosthetic Ankle With Slope Adapting Capabilities	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition	"In this work, the authors first study different designs of prosthetic ankles. Then, a new design is proposed, and its dynamics are discussed. Various experiments are conducted to verify the concept. The results of the experiments are discussed, and a conclusion is drawn based on the discussion. An OpenSim simulation is run to emulate the effects of the prosthesis on an amputee’s residual leg. Further iterations of the same design are then discussed and presented. Finally, a conclusion is drawn on the usability of the ankle along with some suggestions for future research."	"Bhat, S.

2018-11-09	Design and Development of an Unmanned Underwater Vehicle (UUV) in the Form of a Cuttlefish	ASME International Mechanical Engineering Congress and Exposition	"Current methods of unmanned underwater locomotion do not meet stealth, robustness and efficiency. This work discuses about designing a Bioinspired UUV or Unmanned Underwater Vehicle that uses an undulating fin approximating to that of a cuttlefish fin locomotion. This propulsion method has higher maneuverability and ability to navigate while leaving its surroundings relatively undisturbed as compared to other propeller based systems. Mathematical models and control algorithms describing the complicated locomotion have been developed, and a simulation model is used to verify the theoretical results. This design of UUV can be utilized for underwater data collection and military applications without hampering the underwater wildlife."

2018-11-27	Volitional control of an active prosthetic ankle: a survey	International Robotics & Automation Journal	"In this work, state of the art in the field of intent recognition, its application to prostheses and subsequent volitional control algorithms are reviewed. In this paper, competitive landscape is also studied with the aim to learn from the successes and failures of the researchers who have been working in this area. This research hopes to further advance the technology for volitional control of prostheses/wearable robots that will enable much integrated human robot collaboration/interaction specifically focused on passive and active prostheses. The overarching aim of this work is to develop a prosthetic ankle that is as close to a human ankle as possible."	"Bhat, S. G., & Redkar, S. (2018).

2019-03-25	Analysis of a periodic force applied to the trunk to assist walking gait	Wearable Robotics Association Conference (WearRAcon)	"Past research has shown that a horizontal force applied to the trunk greatly assists the user's gait by reducing metabolic cost and reducing the horizontal ground reaction force. Different from the literature which describes a constant applied, horizontal force, the authors hypothesized that a horizontal tether force will not be constant but will oscillate due to the periodic nature of human walking gait. This hypothesis was tested by analyzing the tether force, ground reaction forces, and gait kinematics and kinetics of six able-bodied human participants. An assistive device was designed by attaching a spring-tether to the user's trunk and the other end was affixed to the treadmill. The user naturally found a position on the treadmill to stretch the spring tether. Multiple tethers with different stiffnesses were used. The subjects were asked to walk on a treadmill at 1.2 m.s _1 while wearing the assistive device. Motion data, volumetric rate of …"	"Bhat, S. G., Cherangara, S., Olson, J., Redkar, S., & Sugar, T. G.

2019-08-18	Design and Analysis of an Auto-Parametrically Excited Platform for Active Vibration Control	International Design Engineering Technical Conferences and Computers and Information in Engineering Conference	"Many researchers have proved the potential of autoparametric system in controlling stability and parametric resonance. In this paper, two different designs for auto-parametrically excited mass-spring-damper systems were studied: one system was controlled by rotational motion of the spring, and the other system was controlled by sliding motion of the spring. The theoretical models were developed to predict the behavior of the systems and also generated stability charts to analyze the systems. For each system, the numerical results from both the nonlinear equation and linearized equation were analyzed and compared. Simulation models were constructed to validate the analytical results. The error between simulation and theoretical results was within 2%. Both theoretical and simulation results displayed that the implementation of autoparametric system could help reduce the resonance by up to 33% and …"	"Le, T., Bhat, S. G., Subramanian, S.
